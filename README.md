# React Music Player

### This project is a simple music player that I created to help me familiarize myself with the fundamentals of the React framework.

### The app features a music library menu with music tracks. When clicked, the track will be selected and played if the player is already playing.

### The main player has a play/pause button, seeking buttons, a progress bar that seeks through the track when cicked and information about the track displayed such as the album cover, title and artist.

### On selecting the track, the background colours will change to correspond with the album covers colours.
